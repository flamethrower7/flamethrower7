I am going to have fun with this. I come up with a new business plan daily. I do not run out. The struggle with a creative entrepreneur is that the idea is formulated at "the edge." Most of these beings (those who live at the "edge") cannot monitor shoelace tying consistently. There minds are elsewhere. It is a major turnoff to most other "beings." Especially those who tuck in their shirts. We appear sooooo irresponsible.

The modern process of bringing an idea to life involves: 1) the idea, 2) hand writing the idea (where the passion really pours out). I cannot emphasive actually hand writing the idea down enough. 3) making the idea digitally presentable 4) taking the idea to code. 3 to 4 is a massive gap. Part of it is a values gap (personalities from 1-3 and 4 dont align) and part of it is a resouces gap 4) wants to be paid to slug through the finish line but only rich cronies can afford to pay. I am happy to draw an comic NFT if someone helps me take it to market which will illustrate this GAP. We could make a few thousand by selling a few hundred units. You will have the dreamer on one hand approach the man-child who has been disciplined with a switch his entire life. They are destined not to understand one another and be highly skeptical of working together. In reality, they are a perfect fit... Nonetheless, here is todays tech-start up business plan one of you can run with. I will keep it simple before delving into hardware/software integration and complex monopoly formats which require industry expertise.

What does a simple, viable business plan look like in 2022? Most likely, a Web3 page which links to some "unusual" activity - can connect to your personal vices. This requires: a Webpage, proper checkout and a direct link to a crypto wallet. Ideally, with access to defi - metamask,rainbow etc. Hopefully, most of you realize this. 99.9% ideally. To cite an example: A Webpage/e-commerce store which solves the quality control problem of podcast or soundcloud while simulatenously packaging the sale of joints (or another vice) with a link to a crypto wallet. Times are hard, packaged products and services are necessary! What better way to attract users to a platform than to appeal to their vices they will be adhering to during the platform's experience? Platform comes first, with a longgggg waitlist on the packaged vice due to branding, supply scarcity and of course the Covid supply chain problem. Achive the user adoption and build up first, then figure out how to fufill the orders. If there is user traction you have capital.

I rank this in the lower 10% of ideas most are serious. Focus on the page + vice + crypto wallet hook-up. That is the foundation of "Web3"... The point is to obtain users when FOREX markets are dislocated. The darkweb is most likely run by "centralized user" at this point in time so a direct decentralized exchange to with a hook up to a crypto wallet which is not yet listed on a crypto exchange (defi) if ideal.

For the more business savvy. Study drop-shipping. More importantly, if you are on campus - cross the silk road. Network with your Asian and middle-eastern colleagues. Reason being: they understand eastern culture. Eastern culture is where the growth will exist digitally for the forseeable future, especially when it becomes "mask-off" time again. Every action has an equal an opposite reaction. Internaltionalism will occur and if you want to begin building something that will take several years it is better to build for that world than for a world of isolationism. When you find the right colleages on campus (or in the professional realm, or online) ask them about their consuming preferences. More specifically, which platforms they use to consume their products (ali-express etc).... There are restrictions for the big-tech monopolies to sell into China (for consumer data privacy/national security reasons). Due to this, China's platforms take priority. What does not change, however, is the shipping. Amazon's shipping remains the same and can be used, but the digital payment exchange to the consumer in China does not change. The Chinese state keeps the data but who cares, you are making sales. In order to capitalize you need to sell the right products and at the right time. To sell the right product you need to know your counterpart. Get to know your business partner and all the weird shit they eat or collet! To sell at the right time, you need to study the Chinese calendar. More specifically the special shopping days which are similar to the United States (i.e. our black friday etc). From there, the first step is to list products for sale on the Chinese platforms (like Ali Express). The next step is writing a python script which fufills the order (buying on a US platform ). You can handle shipping yourself at onset then build it. If you all can code better than I you wont need much code, a simple python script will create a real e-commerce business and side hussle. Aim for niche products. You want to sell a few units a week, every week for a few grand a week. Otherwise it will not be worth your time. Opportunity cost is too high. You have one life.

My expertise is in fin-tech and energy markets if any of you want to partner with me, lets! I would love to help the art community through creating NFTs that arent glofied jpeg monetization schemes (I will discuss this next).
